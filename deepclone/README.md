# what is deep cloning ?

Deep cloning refers to the process of creating an exact, independent copy of an object, including all nested objects, arrays, and other complex data types. When you deep clone an object, any changes made to the cloned object or its nested properties do not affect the original object. This is different from shallow cloning, which only copies the top-level properties of an object and can leave references to nested objects intact, meaning changes to those nested objects would affect both the original and cloned object.

## Key Characteristics of Deep Cloning:
- *** Copies Nested Objects and Arrays ***: If the original object has other objects or arrays as its properties, deep cloning creates new copies of these as well.
- *** Independent Objects ***: The clone is completely independent of the original. Changes made to the clone do not affect the original, and vice versa.
- *** Handles Special Data Types ***: Besides basic objects and arrays, deep cloning can also handle dates, sets, maps, and other complex data structures properly.


## When to Use Deep Cloning:

- When working with nested objects or arrays that need to be completely independent.
- In state management (like React or Vue.js) where immutability is important.
- In cases where you want to manipulate data safely without accidentally altering the original structure (e.g., working with API responses, large datasets, etc.).
