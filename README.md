# JavaScript Deep Dive: 15-Day Developer Challenge

Welcome to the **JavaScript Deep Dive: 15-Day Developer Challenge**! This challenge is designed to help you level up your JavaScript skills by focusing on core concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. Over the next 15 days, you'll tackle various challenges that will enhance your understanding and proficiency in vanilla JavaScript.

## Challenge Overview

Each day, you will work on a specific JavaScript challenge aimed at improving your problem-solving skills and deepening your knowledge of the language. These challenges are designed to be completed sequentially but feel free to adjust the order based on your preferences and schedule.

## Challenges

Here's a summary of the 15-day challenge:

| Day 1   | Debounce and Throttle Functions              | Implement debounce and throttle functions to handle events efficiently.                                  | Completed  |
| Day 2   | Custom Event Emitter                         | Build an EventEmitter class to handle custom events (`on()`, `emit()`, `off()`).                         | Completed  |
| Day 3   | Deep Clone Object                            | Write a function to deep clone an object, handling nested objects, arrays, and other data types.          | Not Started  |
| Day 4   | Custom Promise Implementation                | Create a simplified version of JavaScript’s Promise class (`then()`, `catch()`, `finally()`).             | Not Started  |
| Day 5   | Memoization Function                         | Implement memoization to optimize an expensive function (e.g., Fibonacci sequence).                      | Not Started  |
| Day 6   | Currying                                     | Write a currying function to transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions.   | Not Started  |
| Day 7   | Sorting Algorithm (QuickSort)                | Implement the QuickSort algorithm and visualize its step-by-step process.                                | Not Started  |
| Day 8   | Flatten a Nested Array                       | Write a function to flatten a nested array without using `Array.flat()`.                                 | Not Started  |
| Day 9   | Implement Call, Apply, and Bind              | Create custom implementations of JavaScript’s `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods.                 | Not Started  |
| Day 10  | Lodash Clone (Small Utility Library)         | Build a small utility library with functions like `chunk()`, `shuffle()`, and `merge()`.                 | Not Started  |
| Day 11  | Observer Pattern                             | Implement the Observer design pattern, where multiple observers react to changes in a subject.           | Not Started  |
| Day 12  | Function Composition                         | Write a compose function to chain multiple functions together (`compose(f, g, h)(x)` = `f(g(h(x)))`).     | Not Started  |
| Day 13  | Binary Search Algorithm                      | Implement the Binary Search algorithm to efficiently search for an item in a sorted array.               | Not Started  |
| Day 14  | Custom Map and Filter                        | Create custom versions of JavaScript’s `map()` and `filter()` methods for arrays.                        | Not Started  |
| Day 15  | Event Delegation                             | Implement event delegation to handle events for dynamically generated child elements through a parent.    | Not Started  |
